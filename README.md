**Project Description**: The project’s goal is to visualize Georgia election history from 2001 to present day. Specifically, the aim is to create a detailed visualization of Georgia’s role in presidential elections and primaries, detailing county by county election data.


*notes on navigating visualization:
	-make sure to wait until the ga-map is loaded (indicated by the loading/loaded text in the top left corner of the vis) before clicking on a county in order to update the other visualizations properly.
